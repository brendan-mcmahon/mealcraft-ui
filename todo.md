# Meal Planning
- [ ] Would be cool to have a weather API to quickly see if we can cook out or if we should be eating chili or something like that. Extremely minor, but would be cool.
- [ ] Would also be cool to see what's on the calendar in the evening to know if we'll be at home for dinner or not. Extremely minor, but would be cool.
- [ ] Be able to build a "temporary meal" that just is just a group of items. Would be useful for Addie and Walt's lunches, for example so you can add things to the lunchbox without having to create a permanent meal. Actually, "Lunchbox" would be a cool name for that feature.
